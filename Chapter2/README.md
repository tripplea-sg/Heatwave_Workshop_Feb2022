# Connect to MySQL DB System
When working in the cloud, there are often times when your servers and services are not exposed to the public internet. 
The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) MySQL cloud service is an example of a service that is only accessible through private networks. 
Since the service is fully managed, we keep it siloed away from the internet to help protect your data from potential attacks and vulnerabilities. 
It’s a good practice to limit resource exposure as much as possible, but at some point, you’ll likely want to connect to those resources. 
That’s where Compute Instance, also known as a Bastion host, enters the picture. 
This Compute Instance Bastion Host is a resource that sits between the private resource and the endpoint which requires access to the private network 
and can act as a “jump box” to allow you to log in to the private resource through protocols like SSH. This bastion host requires a Virtual Cloud Network a
nd Compute Instance to connect with the MySQL DB Systems.
Today, you will use the Compute Instance to connect from the browser to a MDS DB System

## Task 1: Create SSH Key on OCI Cloud Shell
The Cloud Shell machine is a small virtual machine running a Bash shell which you access through the Oracle Cloud Console (Homepage). You will start the Cloud Shell and generate a SSH Key to use for the Bastion session.
### 1. To start the Oracle Cloud shell, go to your Cloud console and click the cloud shell icon at the top right of the page. This will open the Cloud Shell in the browser, the first time it takes some time to generate it.

### 2. Once the cloud shell has started, create the SSH Key using the following command:
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```
Press enter for each question. \
Here is what it should look like.

### 3. The public and private SSH keys are stored in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
### 4. Examine the two files that you just created.
```
cd .ssh
ls
```

Note in the output there are two files, a private key: id_rsa and a public key: id_rsa.pub. Keep the private key safe and don’t share its content with anyone. The public key will be needed for various activities and can be uploaded to certain systems as well as copied and pasted to facilitate secure communications in the cloud.

## Task 2: Create Compute instance
You will need a compute Instance to connect to your brand new MySQL database.
### 1. Before creating the Compute instance open a notepad
### 2. Do the followings steps to copy the public SSH key to the notepad
Open the Cloud shell 
![Image of picture1](https://github.com/tripplea-sg/Heatwave_Workshop_Feb2022/blob/main/Images/cloudshell-10.png)
Enter the following command
```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

### 3. Copy the id_rsa.pub content the notepad
Your notepad should look like this

### 4. To launch a Linux Compute instance, go to Navigation Menu Compute Instances 
![Image of picture1](https://github.com/tripplea-sg/Heatwave_Workshop_Feb2022/blob/main/Images/05compute01.png)
### 5. On Instances in (root) Compartment, click Create Instance
![Image of picture1](https://github.com/tripplea-sg/Heatwave_Workshop_Feb2022/blob/main/Images/05compute02_00.png)
### 6. On Create Compute Instance
Enter Name
```
MDS-Client
```
### 7. Make sure (root) compartment is selected
### 8. On Placement, keep the selected Availability Domain
### 9. On Image and Shape, keep the selected Image, Oracle Linux 7.9
![Image of picture1](https://github.com/tripplea-sg/Heatwave_Workshop_Feb2022/blob/main/Images/05compute03.png)
### 10. Select Instance Shape: VM.Standard2.2
![Image of picture1](https://github.com/tripplea-sg/Heatwave_Workshop_Feb2022/blob/main/Images/05compute-shape.png)
### 11. On Networking, make sure ‘MDS-VCN’ is selected
‘Assign a public IP address’ should be set to Yes
![Image of picture1](https://github.com/tripplea-sg/Heatwave_Workshop_Feb2022/blob/main/Images/05compute04.png)
### 12. On Add SSH keys, paste the public key from the notepad.
![Image of picture1](https://github.com/tripplea-sg/Heatwave_Workshop_Feb2022/blob/main/Images/05compute-id-rsa-paste.png)
### 13. Click ‘Create’ to finish creating your Compute Instance.
### 14. The New Virtual Machine will be ready to use after a few minutes. The state will be shown as ‘Provisioning’ during the creation 
![Image of picture1](https://github.com/tripplea-sg/Heatwave_Workshop_Feb2022/blob/main/Images/05compute07.png)
### 15. The state ‘Running’ indicates that the Virtual Machine is ready to use.
On the MDS-Client Instance page under ‘Instance Access’, Copy and save the Public IP Address

## Task 3: Connect to MySQL Database System
### 1. Copy the public IP address of the active Compute Instance to your notepad
Go to Navigation Menu Compute Instances 
![Image of picture1](https://github.com/tripplea-sg/Heatwave_Workshop_Feb2022/blob/main/Images/db-list.png)
Click the MDS-Client Compute Instance link 
![Image of picture1](https://github.com/tripplea-sg/Heatwave_Workshop_Feb2022/blob/main/Images/db-active.png)
Copy MDS-Client plus the Public IP Address to the notepad
### 2. Copy the private IP address of the active MySQl Database Service Instance to your notepad
Go to Navigation Menu Databases MySQL
![Image of picture1](https://github.com/tripplea-sg/Heatwave_Workshop_Feb2022/blob/main/Images/db-list.png)
Click the MDS-HW Database System link
![Image of picture1](https://github.com/tripplea-sg/Heatwave_Workshop_Feb2022/blob/main/Images/db-active.png)
