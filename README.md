# About This Workshop
In this hands-on workshop, you’ll be introduced to Oracle MySQL Database Service and HeatWave. MySQL Database Service is a powerful union between MySQL Enterprise Edition and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). HeatWave greatly extends MySQL Database Service by offering a massively parallel, high-performance, in-memory query accelerator that accelerates MySQL performance by orders of magnitude for analytics and mixed workloads.  
Workshop prerequisites:

    1. Familiarity with MySQL Database is desirable is required
    2. Some understanding of cloud and database terms is helpful
    3. Familiarity with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is required
    
 In this workshop, you will learn how to create a MySQL HeatWave Cluster, connect to the cluster using MySQL Shell and MySQL Workbench, and run queries on HeatWave. You will learn how easy it is to create and manage MySQL HeatWave, and how MySQL HeatWave enables you to make informed business-critical decision with real-time insights. \
 MySQL Database Service with HeatWave is a fully managed service, optimized for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. It enables you to:

    1. Instantly provision MySQL instances and connect to a production ready, pre-configured MySQL database.
    2. Run OLTP and OLAP workload directly on a single MySQL platform without the need of ETL, and no change in your applications.
    3. Efficiently run mixed and analytics workloads with best price performance. HeatWave is 6.5X faster than Amazon Redshift at half the cost, 7X faster than Snowflake at one-fifth the cost, and 1400X faster than Amazon Aurora at half the cost.
    4. Make more informed business decision by getting real-time insights from your operational data.
    5. Free up time of developers, DBAs, and DevOps to focus on value added tasks that are core to your business.
    6. Access to dozens of additional Oracle Cloud Services enabling organizations to embrace the shift to the cloud.
